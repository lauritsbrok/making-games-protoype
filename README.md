# Making Games Prototype

## Game Concept
Making Games Prototype is a fast-paced third-person survival shooter built in Godot 4. You control an agile pilot who auto-fires energy bolts while fending off endlessly spawning enemies. The goal is to stay alive and outmaneuver the incoming horde for as long as possible.

- **Endless waves:** Enemies spawn in expanding rings around the player. Each wave spawns faster and enemies gain more health, creating an escalating difficulty curve.
- **Responsive movement:** WASD (or arrow keys) move the character relative to the camera. Mouse look lets you strafe, kite, and keep targets in sight.
- **Auto-fire combat:** The player fires a steady stream of projectiles at the point of aim. Bullets travel quickly, dealing damage on contact and despawning after a set range.
- **Skill expression:** Master positioning, kiting, and aiming to extend your run. Staying mobile is the key to survival.
